### Hi there üëãüèæ

I'm a TypeScript/Node.js software developer in Portland, OR, [currently employed at OpenSesame](https://www.opensesame.com/site/blog/employee-spotlight-elias-jackson/). I am passionate about listening to, organizing, and making music, and much of my programming is related to that.

## Coding projects

These are mostly on hold, as my main focuses right now are my [job](https://www.opensesame.com/site/blog/employee-spotlight-elias-jackson/) and my [music projects](#music).

### Websites

- [Patrician](https://github.com/patricianapp): A web application and GraphQL API for organizing and sharing your physical and/or digital album collection. Its biggest inspiration is RateYourMusic.com, but its key difference is that it will be heavily profile-focused. Setting it apart from other music collection sites, it features expressive profile customization, easy importing from music players/online profiles/text files, advanced querying through the search bar and API, and Last.fm integration.
- [Resources](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/resources): An attempt at creating a personal bookmark manager organized by topic which also includes embedded Wikipedia articles, breadcrumb navigation, and search. The idea was that V1 would be a static site generated from YAML files, [EJS](https://ejs.co) templates, and a [custom build script](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/resources/blob/main/build.js), and V2 would potentially make use of a real database and API so that I could add bookmarks using the site itself.
- [Album Voting](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/listening-circle-voting-app): A quick site I put together for my music podcast to vote on which albums we want to review. Uses Google login via Firebase.

### Discord Bots

- [Article Bot](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/article-bot): A bot that my friends and I use for sharing articles for us to read and discuss.
- [Harmonia](https://github.com/patricianapp/Harmonia): A bot for sharing and listening to music, as well as posting Last.fm charts and stats (it is based on [FMCord](https://github.com/kometh0616/fmcord), a Last.fm bot). Songs can be shared from YouTube and Spotify, and can automatically be cross-posted to a subreddit and a Spotify playlist. In addition, there is a leaderboard feature which posts the top-voted songs in the Discord server by day, week, or month.
- [Omniscience](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/omniscience): A bot for looking up Wikipedia articles and other research info.

### Scripts/Automations

- [Solutions](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/podcast/tree/main/scripts): A GitHub Actions workflow for my [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2mmb9lTkWVwMI1UEe5rZqA?si=2d9ddac99fb94a34) which listens for updates to YAML files to run the following actions: auto-generate and upload an RSS feed to use in podcast apps, save show notes to a Markdown file, and create/update the corresponding Reddit post for discussing the episode.
- [Exportify Organizer](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/exportify-organizer): Organize archived Spotify playlists in CSV format. [Example output repo](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/playlists)
- [RYM Local Webhook](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/rym-local-webhook): Parses the RateYourMusic chart page and creating a Discord webhook post of the top albums.

### Libraries

- [YouTube Album Search](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/youtube-album-search): Search **albums** (not songs or music videos) using YouTube's API.
- [MBFC Node](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/mbfc-node): Get [MediaBiasFactCheck.com](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com) info for any site based on article URL.

When I'm not coding, I'm making heavy music in Ableton! Check out the links below to see more:
