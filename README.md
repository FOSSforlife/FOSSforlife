### Hi there 👋🏾

I'm a TypeScript/Node.js software developer in Portland, OR, currently employed at [OpenSesame](https://www.linkedin.com/company/opensesame_2/). I am passionate about listening to, organizing, and making music, and much of my programming is related to that.

### Ongoing main project
[![Patrician](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=patricianapp&repo=patrician)](https://github.com/patricianapp/patrician)

A project of mine that is currently transitioning from the brainstorming stage to early prototyping (though there is much overlap) is [Patrician](https://github.com/patricianapp/patrician), a web application and GraphQL API for organizing and sharing your physical and/or digital album collection. Its biggest inspiration is RateYourMusic.com (or, as it will soon be named, Sonemic), but its key difference is that it will be heavily profile-focused. Setting it apart from other music collection sites, it features expressive profile customization, easy importing from music players/online profiles/text files, advanced querying through the search bar and API, and Last.fm integration.

This is planned to be a huge project which will require lots of hard work and talent. Soon, I will be recruiting other developers who share my passion for music collection. Here's the tech stack I plan on using:
- Frontend: 
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- API: [Warthog](https://github.com/goldcaddy77/warthog) ([TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) + [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/))
- Serverless Functions: Most likely TypeScript/Node
  - This will be where large imports are made, so that they don't clog up the main thread
- Database: [Amazon Aurora (Postgres)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora)
- Deployment: 
  - UI: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - API: Probably [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) at first, may eventually use AWS services
  - Functions: [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    - Amazon MQ or SQS for queueing

If you're interested in joining the team or contributing, [reach out to me](#contact) and take a look at the [GitHub repos](https://github.com/patricianapp). We use [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) as our project management tool, which allows unlimited team members for free since it's an open source project. 

### Side projects
- [Harmonia](https://github.com/patricianapp/Harmonia): A Discord bot for sharing and listening to music, as well as posting Last.fm charts and stats (it is based on [FMCord](https://github.com/kometh0616/fmcord), a Last.fm bot). Songs can be shared from YouTube and Spotify, and can automatically be cross-posted to a subreddit and a Spotify playlist. In addition, there is a leaderboard feature which posts the top-voted songs in the Discord server by day, week, or month.

### Interests
- Open source
- E-learning (that's what the company I work for specializes in!)
- Writing music in code (haven't delved into it yet, but there are some [promising](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) [tools](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) [out](https://github.com/ales-tsurko/cells) [there](https://github.com/flipcoder/textbeat))
- Writing wavetables in code (trying to learn syntax for u-He Hive, Vital, and Serum)
- Editing video in code ([editly](https://github.com/mifi/editly))
- Desktop Linux
- Spotify
- Music recommendation/analysis algorithms
- Data science

### Other Projects?

#### Podcast
Outside of coding, I also host two podcasts, [one of which](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtM9VzujJ4bK-82xIi0vKFQ) is about music (surprise surprise), and [the other](https://medium.com/solutions) is about finding solutions to societal problems. I store the episode metadata in a [JSON file](https://github.com/FOSSforlife/podcast-site/blob/master/src/assets/data/episodes.json) and have a script that generates the podcast RSS from it and deploys it to Netlify. The episodes are hosted on DigitalOcean Spaces.

#### Musicmaking
I play drums, bass, and piano. Most of my musical creation is through jamming with my friends (as well as random noodling in Ableton/Serum), but I have also played in a few bands in the past. In 2019, I played drums in a noisecore band called Christian Lovers, and while I was in the band we played several improvised live shows, recorded an [EP](https://christianlovers.bandcamp.com/album/bullshit-market-christian-lovers-split) and got to play a live set on [UCLA Radio](https://soundcloud.com/uclaradio/christain-lovers-live-ucla-radio). I also recorded drums for a friend of mine's post-metal solo project "Heaven is at a Distance", which you can find on his [Bandcamp page](https://jonathanfraser.bandcamp.com/music).

Since moving to Portland in Jan 2020 and working full-time as a developer (not to mention being quarantined due to a pandemic...), I haven't joined any bands up here yet and am not as focused on music creation lately. That said, I still practice and jam with people every now and then, and will eventually get back into producing and creating on a regular basis.
