### Hi there 👋 

I'm a TypeScript/Node.js software developer in Portland, OR, currently employed at OpenSesame. I am passionate about listening to, organizing, and making music, and much of my personal programming is related to that.

#### Ongoing main project
A project of mine that is currently transitioning from the brainstorming stage to early prototyping (though there is much overlap) is [Patrician](https://github.com/patricianapp/patrician), a web application and GraphQL API for organizing and sharing your physical and/or digital album collection. Its biggest inspiration is RateYourMusic.com (soon to be Sonemic), but its key difference is that it will be heavily profile-focused. Setting it apart from other music collection sites, it will feature expressive profile customization, easy importing from music players and other sites, advanced querying through the search bar and API, and Last.fm integration.

This is planned to be a huge project, and as such, will require lots of hard work and talent. Soon, I will be recruiting other developers who share my passion for music collection. Here's the tech stack I plan on using:
- Frontend: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Apollo Client
- Backend: Warthog (TypeORM + TypeGraphQL)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Vercel (UI), probably Heroku, maybe AWS at some point (API)

#### Side projects
- [Harmonia](https://github.com/patricianapp/Harmonia): A Discord bot for sharing and listening to music, as well as posting Last.fm charts and stats (it is based on FMCord, a Last.fm bot). Songs can be shared from YouTube and Spotify, and can automatically be cross-posted to a subreddit and a Spotify playlist. In addition, there is a leaderboard feature which posts the top-voted songs in the Discord server by day, week, or month.

#### Other things I'm interested in
- E-learning (that's what the company I work for specializes in!)
- Writing music in code (haven't delved into it yet, but there are some promising libraries out there)
- Writing wavetables in code (trying to learn syntax for u-He Hive and Vital)

Outside of coding, I also host a [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/listeningcircle/) where we talk about (...can you guess?) music!
